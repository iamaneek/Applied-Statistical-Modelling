# Applied-Statistical-Modelling

Abstract

This work is based on a Yelp dataset which contains business and customer review information of several
restaurants across the neighbourhoods of Toronto, Canada. With large number of restaurants distributed across all
neighbourhoods, several analyses are conducted through various statistical modelling, namely Markov Chain Monte
Carlo Methods, Gibbs Sampling and Hierarchical Linear Models. The relationship between neighborhoods and
different categories are established and identified.
